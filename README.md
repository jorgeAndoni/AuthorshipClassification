# AuthorshipClassification
In this study, I devised a methodology grounded in word co-occurrence networks and word embeddings to facilitate authorship attribution of English literary books through a network-based approach.

## Datasets
For the purpose of authorship classification, I utilized a dataset encompassing 78 English books, with each of the 13 authors contributing 6 books. The selected authors for this study were Hector Hugh, Thomas Hardy, Daniel Defoe, Allan Poe, Bram Stoker, Mark Twain, Charles Dickens, Pelham Grenville, Charles Darwin, Arthur Doyle, George Eliot, Jane Austen, and Joseph Conrad. Below is a table that displays various authors along with their respective books, which were considered for assembling this dataset.

Hector Hugh | Thomas Hardy  | Daniel Defoe | Allan Poe |
|---- | ---- | --- | --- |
| The Toys of Peace  | A Pair of Blue Eyes  | Memoirs of a Cavalier |  The Works of Edgar Allan Poe - V1 
| The Unbearable Bassington   | A Changed Man  | Colonel Jack  |  The Works of Edgar Allan Poe - V2 
|  Beasts and Super-Beasts  | Jude the Obscure  | The Fortunate Mistress |  The Works of Edgar Allan Poe - V3 

Bram Stoker |  Mark Twain  | Charles Dickens | Pelham Grenville |
|---- | ---- | --- | --- |
| The Lady of the Shroud  | Life on the Mississippi |  Oliver Twist |   My Man Jeeves
| The Mystery of the Sea | The Prince and the Pauper | David Copperfield |  The Clicking of Cuthbert 
| The Man | The Innocents Abroad | A Tale of Two Cities  | The Man with Two Left Feet
