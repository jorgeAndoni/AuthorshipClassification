# AuthorshipClassification
In this study, I devised a methodology grounded in word co-occurrence networks and word embeddings to facilitate authorship attribution of English literary books through a network-based approach.

## Datasets

The list of books is shown in Tables S1

The following authors were considered: Hector Hugh, Thomas Hardy, Daniel Defoe, Allan Poe, Bram Stoker, Mark Twain, Charles Dickens, Pelham Grenville, Charles Darwin, Arthur Doyle, George Eliot, Jane Austen, and Joseph Conrad.

6 libros x 13 autores : 78 libros

In our previous work~\cite{QUISPE2021125344}, we developed a word co-occurrence network-based methodology for authorship attribution, where we analyzed literary books of varying sizes. 

Hector Hugh | Thomas Hardy  | Daniel Defoe | Allan Poe |
|---- | ---- | --- | --- |
| The Toys of Peace  | A Pair of Blue Eyes  | Memoirs of a Cavalier |  The Works of Edgar Allan Poe - V1 
| The Unbearable Bassington   | A Changed Man  | Colonel Jack  |  The Works of Edgar Allan Poe - V2 
|  Beasts and Super-Beasts  | Jude the Obscure  | The Fortunate Mistress |  The Works of Edgar Allan Poe - V3 

Bram Stoker |  Mark Twain  | Charles Dickens | Pelham Grenville |
|---- | ---- | --- | --- |
| The Lady of the Shroud  | Life on the Mississippi |  Oliver Twist |   My Man Jeeves
| The Mystery of the Sea | The Prince and the Pauper | David Copperfield |  The Clicking of Cuthbert 
| The Man | The Innocents Abroad | A Tale of Two Cities  | The Man with Two Left Feet
