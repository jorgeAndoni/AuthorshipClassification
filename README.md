# AuthorshipClassification
In this study, I devised a methodology grounded in word co-occurrence networks and word embeddings to facilitate authorship attribution of English literary books through a network-based approach.

## Datasets

The list of books is shown in Tables S1

The following authors were considered: Hector Hugh (HH),
Thomas Hardy (TH), Daniel Defoe (DD), Allan Poe (AP), Bram Stoker (BS), Mark Twain
(MT), Charles Dickens (CD), Pelham Grenville (PG), Charles Darwin (CD), Arthur Doyle
(AD), George Eliot (GE), Jane Austen (JA), and Joseph Conrad (JC)

6 libros x 13 autores : 78 libros

In our previous work~\cite{QUISPE2021125344}, we developed a word co-occurrence network-based methodology for authorship attribution, where we analyzed literary books of varying sizes.
